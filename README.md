# Genetic-Analysis-of-Bacteria-using-PCA
*Numerical Methods of Data Science Project*
## Description:
Bacteria is a unicellular, microscopic organisms which survive in huge numbers, approximately millions.
Few of these bacteria are harmful but majority of them are useful to human lives and the environment. These organisms have been found to be the first living thing on the planet for around 4 billion years ago. They support many life forms on earth including humans, plants and animals. 

Bacteria Genetics is study of composition,structure and inherited data present in the microorganisms. This study is been used across the world in various industries which includes medical industries, food and beverages industries, agricultural industries and many more.

In this project we have examined genetic information applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and build a model that predicts and can classify species of bacterial.
